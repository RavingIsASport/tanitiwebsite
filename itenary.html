      <h3>Activities</h3>
      <h4>Entertainment:</h4>
      <p>
        people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest, and
        visit the volcano. However, there are other things to do, including
        visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours,
        snorkeling, zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs,
        including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie,
        taking helicopter rides, playing at an arcade, visiting art galleries,
        and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course should be operational by next
        year. Many of these activities are in Merriton Landing, which is a
        rapidly developing area on the north side of Yellow Leaf Bay.
      </p>
      <h4>Sightseeing:</h4>
      <p>

        Leaf Bay.

      <h3>Transportation</h3>
      <p>
        Almost all visitors arrive in Taniti by air, though some arrive on a
        small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week.
        Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and
        propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so
        larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few
        years.
      </p>
      <h4>Ground Transportation</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every
          day.
        </li>

          Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets
          are required by law).
        </li>
      </ul>
